MinneHack 2025 - Foster strong local communities

This project was made as part of a team for a hackathon (Minnehack 2025). My involvement is the UI elements and react components that make up the different pages of the site. I did not have personal involvement with back end code written in rust or deployment files.

# Prerequisites
1. Node.js and npm
2. VS Code with the Live Server extension

# Install and Run
Open your terminal and apply these steps
```bash
cd food-app

npm install

npm install axios react-datepicker
```
Finally, to view the page run:
```bash
npm run dev
```
